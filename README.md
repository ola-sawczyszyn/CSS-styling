Objectives:
Create a style sheet and link it to the html files.  (Without changing the html.)
Style the sheet using the properties color, background-color, text-align, text-transform, and/or display

Steps:

Create a file called hw1.css and save it in your css folder.

Style the page using the following rules:

1) Style the header with a background color

2) h1 elements should be centered and have a new font color

3) h2 elements should have a new font color

4) Sections should have a new background color

5) The links should  have a new font color and background color (**NOTE: earlier version of this assignment required that the link be centered.  So if someone has centered them, do not deduct points.)

6 ) The images should not appear on the page
